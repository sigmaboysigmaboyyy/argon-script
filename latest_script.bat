echo.
echo If you see this screen, show it to a support member from the ticket.
echo.
echo ------------------------------------------------
echo To the people of Argon who welcomed me with warmth and gratitude in countless tickets, thank you, really thank you alot.
echo Sovereign, for being the first to guide me and help in tickets, and Minty, for being with me throughout this journey, thank you.
echo ------------------------------------------------
echo Despite my best efforts, the Russo-Ukrainian war took a toll on my mental health, leading to moments of aggression.
echo And I'm sincerely sorry for these moments to happen.
echo.
echo ------------------------------------------------
echo I hope this message prompts a reconsideration of Argon as a community,
echo since I have never got so much stress in 1 week, waking up to check my phone,
echo if i got demoted for nothing, and such was hapenning almost whole career path,
echo -----
echo STRESS, STRESS AND AGAIN STRESS
echo -----
echo I have spent many time on that server, having nothing, gave everything to support members, yet, no one gives a fuck... ABDU and others are vindictive people there.
echo Many staff members do nothing on Argon, and I was bullied by Ven and Rapid simply for helping others and being promoted quickly. (which is ridiculous, right?)
echo Abdu told me to share all of the problems to his DMs, but recently told me to "shut the fuck up, crying baby." and demoted for that...
echo ------------------------------------------------
echo I see no point in staying with Argon anymore.
echo Management doesn't care, allowing a staff member to leave after being bullied over 72 times for no reason. (and I was the only person who noticed that, and helped...)
echo This is not a joke.
echo -------
echo I wanted Argon to be the best, spent all of my soul into it, yet, turned out to be an outcast...
echo There's so many other stuff to say, yet....
echo NO ONE GIVES A F U C K.
echo Sorry, it was bad decision to be part of that community, as Head Moderator.
echo ------
echo I hope yall will reconsider who you have as staff, and who you have as manager.
echo.
